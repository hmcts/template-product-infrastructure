# Product infrastructure template

## Template development

We are using [nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) for the template powered by Backstage software templates.

Currently there's no way to run it easily apart from via Backstage.
Follow https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/6568 for better solutions
